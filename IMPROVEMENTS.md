# Cubeia Wallet Improvements

This document outlines the significant improvements made to the Cubeia Wallet application, detailing each enhancement's motivation, implementation approach, benefits, and potential future extensions.

## 1. Deadlock Prevention Strategy

### Original Issue
- The initial implementation lacked a robust strategy for preventing deadlocks during concurrent transfers.
- When multiple threads attempted to transfer between the same accounts in opposite directions, deadlocks could occur.

### Implementation
- Implemented a consistent lock ordering strategy based on account IDs.
- When transferring between accounts, locks are always acquired in the same order:
  ```java
  // Determine lock order based on account IDs
  if (fromAccountId.compareTo(toAccountId) <= 0) {
      // Lock accounts in natural order
      fromAccount = accountRepository.findByIdWithLock(fromAccountId);
      toAccount = accountRepository.findByIdWithLock(toAccountId);
  } else {
      // Lock accounts in reversed order
      toAccount = accountRepository.findByIdWithLock(toAccountId);
      fromAccount = accountRepository.findByIdWithLock(fromAccountId);
  }
  ```
- Added extensive testing using `DeadlockPreventionTest` that creates concurrent transfers in opposite directions.

### Benefits
- Eliminates the possibility of deadlocks in the system.
- Ensures high throughput even under high concurrency.
- Maintains data integrity during concurrent operations.
- Provides a simple but effective solution that's easy to understand and maintain.

### Future Improvements
- Consider distributed locking mechanisms for a horizontally scaled environment.
- Explore adaptive backoff strategies for high contention scenarios.
- Implement deadlock detection as an added safety measure.

## 2. Idempotent Transaction Processing

### Original Issue
- The original system lacked idempotent API endpoints, making it unsafe to retry failed transfers.
- Retried requests could potentially create duplicate transactions and incorrect balances.

### Implementation
- Added optional `referenceId` parameter to the transfer API.
- Modified the `Transaction` model to include a `reference` field.
- Updated `TransactionRepository` to search by reference ID.
- Enhanced `TransactionService` to check for existing transactions with the same reference ID:
  ```java
  // Check for existing transaction with the same reference ID for idempotency
  if (referenceId != null && !referenceId.isEmpty()) {
      Optional<Transaction> existingTransaction = transactionRepository.findByReference(referenceId);
      if (existingTransaction.isPresent()) {
          Transaction existing = existingTransaction.get();
          
          // Verify that transaction parameters match
          if (!existing.getFromAccountId().equals(fromAccountId) ||
              !existing.getToAccountId().equals(toAccountId) ||
              existing.getAmount().compareTo(amount) != 0) {
              throw InvalidTransactionException.forDuplicateReference(referenceId);
          }
          
          // Return the existing transaction for idempotency
          return existing;
      }
  }
  ```
- Added comprehensive tests for idempotent behavior.

### Benefits
- Allows safe retries of transfer operations.
- Prevents duplicate transactions from being created.
- Ensures exactly-once semantics for financial operations.
- Improves API robustness in unstable network conditions.

### Future Improvements
- Implement time-based expiration for reference IDs.
- Add client-side retry strategies with exponential backoff.
- Consider using UUIDs for reference IDs to avoid collisions.

## 3. Transaction Management with TransactionTemplate

### Original Issue
- The original implementation used annotation-based transaction management with `@Transactional`.
- This approach made it difficult to control transaction boundaries precisely.
- Transaction scopes were often larger than necessary, affecting performance.

### Implementation
- Replaced `@Transactional` annotations with explicit `TransactionTemplate` usage.
- Injected `PlatformTransactionManager` to create a properly configured template.
- Wrapped only critical sections in transaction boundaries:
  ```java
  return getTransactionTemplate().execute(status -> {
      // Execute the transaction using our method
      // This handles account locking, validation, and balance updates
      executeTransaction(transaction);
      
      // Save and return the transaction record
      return transactionRepository.save(transaction);
  });
  ```
- Added clear comments explaining the benefits of this approach.

### Benefits
- More explicit and fine-grained control over transaction boundaries.
- Reduced lock holding time by minimizing transaction scope.
- Improved readability by making transaction boundaries visually clear.
- Enhanced performance by shortening the critical section.

### Future Improvements
- Consider read-only transactions for query operations.
- Implement transaction timeout strategies for long-running operations.
- Explore programmatic transaction attribute configuration for specific use cases.

## 4. Simplified Transaction Execution Model

### Original Issue
- The original `Transaction` model contained business logic that should belong in the service layer.
- This mixed persistence concerns with business rules, violating separation of concerns.

### Implementation
- Refactored `Transaction` to be a simple data container.
- Moved all business logic from the model to the `TransactionService`.
- Implemented a protected `executeTransaction` method in the service layer.
- Maintained the same validations and business rules.

### Benefits
- Improved separation of concerns.
- Enhanced testability by isolating business logic.
- Simplified the model class.
- Made the codebase more maintainable by following better architectural patterns.

### Future Improvements
- Consider using a command pattern for transaction execution.
- Implement an audit log for transaction executions.
- Add hooks for pre-transaction and post-transaction processing.

## 5. Account Type Design

### Original Issue
- The account type implementation lacked clear documentation on its design decisions.
- The pattern matching approach was more complex than necessary.

### Implementation
- Added detailed documentation explaining the sealed interface approach.
- Simplified implementation while maintaining the type-safe approach.
- Documented real-world uses for different account types:
  ```java
  /**
   * A sealed interface representing different types of accounts with specific rules and properties.
   * 
   * In a production system, different account types would have additional properties and behaviors:
   * - Regular accounts: Standard accounts for normal operations
   * - Bonus accounts: Temporary accounts with expiration dates and special withdrawal rules
   * - Pending accounts: Accounts with transactions pending settlement
   * - Jackpot accounts: Special accounts with regulatory restrictions on withdrawals
   */
  public sealed interface AccountType permits MainAccount, BonusAccount, PendingAccount {
      // Interface methods...
  }
  ```

### Benefits
- Improved code clarity through better documentation.
- Maintained type safety while reducing complexity.
- Provided a clear explanation of design decisions.
- Illustrated real-world use cases for the pattern.

### Future Improvements
- Consider adding more account types based on business requirements.
- Implement type-specific validation rules.
- Add balance computation methods specific to each account type.

## 6. Enhanced Error Handling

### Original Issue
- The original error handling used generic exceptions.
- Error responses lacked consistency in format and detail.
- HTTP status codes weren't always appropriate for the error condition.

### Implementation
- Created specific exception classes for different error scenarios:
  - `AccountNotFoundException`
  - `CurrencyMismatchException`
  - `InsufficientFundsException`
  - `InvalidTransactionException`
- Implemented a centralized `GlobalExceptionHandler` that:
  - Maps exceptions to appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Returns consistent error response format
  - Includes helpful error messages
- Updated service code to use the new specific exceptions.

### Benefits
- Improved error clarity for API clients.
- Enhanced debugging through specific exception types.
- Consistent error format across the entire API.
- Appropriate HTTP status codes for different error conditions.

### Future Improvements
- Add error codes for programmatic error handling by clients.
- Implement internationalization for error messages.
