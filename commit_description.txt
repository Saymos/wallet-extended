This commit includes the following improvements:

1. Account Model:
   - Made currency and accountType fields immutable (final)
   - Removed unnecessary setters (setId, setBalance)
   - Added a protected constructor for JPA
   - Made balance updates only possible through transactions

2. Transaction Model:
   - Created a self-execution pattern with transaction.execute(transaction, fromAccount, toAccount)
   - Added validation for currency matching between accounts
   - Made the basic execute method private to enforce proper usage
   - Implemented proper account balance modifications

3. Domain Enhancements:
   - Added Currency enum with ISO 4217 standard reference
   - Added AccountType enum with MAIN, BONUS, PENDING, and JACKPOT types
   - Added TransactionType enum for better categorization of financial movements

4. Validation and Security:
   - Added currency matching between accounts for transfers
   - Improved error handling with proper exceptions
   - Made transaction execution the only way to modify account balances

5. Updated Tests:
   - Modified existing tests to work with immutable fields
   - Added tests for currency mismatch scenarios
   - Added tests for account types and transaction validation

These changes ensure data integrity by enforcing that account balances can only be modified through properly recorded transactions.
